/**
 * The modulo operator, denoted by `%` in many programming languages including
 * Java, calculates the remainder of a division operation. It's commonly used in
 * various mathematical and programming contexts for a variety of purposes.
 * Here's an overview of the modulo operator and some of its properties:
 * 
 * 1. **Modulo Operator**: The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the
 * division of two numbers. For example:
 * - `7 % 3` evaluates to `1` because 7 divided by 3 equals 2 with a remainder
 * of 1.
 * - `-7 % 3` evaluates to `-1` because -7 divided by 3 equals -2 with a
 * remainder of -1, but in Java, the sign of the result is determined by the
 * dividend, so it returns -1 instead of 2.
 * 
 * 2. **Congruence**: Two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are said to be congruent
 * modulo \(n\) (denoted \(a \equiv b \mod n\)) if they have the same remainder
 * when divided by \(n\). For example, \(7 \equiv 1 \mod 3\) because both 7 and
 * 1 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
 * 
 * 3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for
 * integers where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value called
 * the modulus. For example, in modulo 7 arithmetic, after reaching 6, the next
 * number is 0. Modular arithmetic is used in cryptography, computer science,
 * and number theory.
 * 
 * 4. **Multiplicative Modulo Inverse**: The multiplicative modulo inverse of a
 * number \(a\) modulo \(n\) is another number \(b\) such that \(a \cdot b
 * \equiv 1 \mod n\). In other words, \(b\) is the number that, when multiplied
 * by \(a\), results in a remainder of 1 when divided by \(n\). Not all numbers
 * have a multiplicative modulo inverse, and when they do, it's unique modulo
 * \(n\). For example:
 * - The multiplicative modulo inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5 because \(3 \cdot 5
 * \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
 * - The multiplicative modulo inverse of 4 modulo 7 does not exist because
 * there is no integer \(b\) such that \(4 \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
 * 
 * 5. **Properties**:
 * - The multiplicative modulo inverse exists for a number \(a\) modulo \(n\) if
 * and only if \(a\) and \(n\) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor
 * is 1).
 * - If \(a \equiv b \mod n\) and \(c \equiv d \mod n\), then \(a + c \equiv b +
 * d \mod n\) and \(a \cdot c \equiv b \cdot d \mod n\).
 * - If \(a \equiv b \mod n\), then \(a^k \equiv b^k \mod n\) for any positive
 * integer \(k\).
 * - If \(a \equiv b \mod n\) and \(c \equiv d \mod n\), then \(a^c \equiv b^d
 * \mod n\).
 * - If \(a \equiv b \mod n\) and \(c \equiv d \mod n\), then \(a^c \equiv b^d
 * \mod n\).
 * 
 * These properties are fundamental in various areas of mathematics and computer
 * science, including number theory, cryptography, and algorithms. They play a
 * crucial role in designing efficient algorithms and ensuring the security of
 * cryptographic systems.
